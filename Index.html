        <h2> Who are the Boko Haram?</h2>
            <div class="Abubakar">
            <p>The Boko Haram is a terrorist group active in west African countries based in northeastern Nigera. Led by Abubakar Shekau, the group heavily opposes the westernization of their societies (their name translates to western education is forbidden/ a lot is forbidden). Their goal is to overthrow the Nigerian government and replace it with a fully "islamic" regime. </p>

        <h2> April 1, 2014</h2>
        <div class="par"
        <p>On the night of April 1st, the Boko haram kidnapped 276 girls from Government Girls Secondary school in Chibok, Borno State. The terrorist group bases its attacks on “forbidden” places, such as bars, and in this case a widely Christian school. Prior to their raid, the school was closed for weeks due to security threats. On this day, the girls were allowed in school to take their final exams.

        <p>Ransom kidnappings are among the Boko Harams primary resources for funding; The Boko Haram demands ransoms of up to $300,000, and/or release of their victims in exchange for imprisoned members. In May 2013, Boko Haram kidnapped 12 women, and exchanged them for the release of 90 of their members and ransom money. This encouraged them to carry out more kidnappings. It is assumed that the Chibok kidnappings were carried out by a unit leader in Gwoza, Ibrahim Tada Nagalike in coordination with Boko Haram's leaders, including Aminu "Tashen-Ilmi," Nur, al-Barnawi and Abubakar Shekau.

        <h2>Responses of Nigeria and effects</h2>
        <div class="par"
        <p>Families of the victims were extremely devastated both mentally and physically by the kidnapping.  They received no real closure, hearing of their daughters from the Boko Haram themselves rather than the government. 
        </p>
        <p>President Jonathan called a state of emergency in the northeast (where Boko Haram is most active) before the kidnappings to launch a counter insurgency offensive with a budget of almost 6 million dollars. Despite the amount of money spent, it was largely ineffective. The military is out numbered and severly lacking in weapons compared to the terrorist organization. Their inability to defeat Boko Haram after years has caused increased hatred of the government.

        <h2>How did the USA respond? </h2>
        <div class="par"
        <p>The US provided assistance to the Nigeria's government mainly by sending a multidisciplinary team to Nigeria to secure the safe return of the victims and providing access to intelligence and surveillance to find the girls. In the view of the Nigerians, both the US government and their own has been incompetent is resolving this issue. As said by Joshua Earnest,  the US press secretary under President Obama in  2016 , “the threat still remains.  And it is quite serious.  And it’s why the United States continues to be committed to supporting them as they counter that threat”.

        <h2>
         Where are they now? 
        </h2>
        <div class="par"
        <p> 57 girls were able to escape immediately after being captured. Approximately 100 were released, but as of April 2021, over 100 are still imprisoned, many assumed to be dead. Many of the now free girls are deeply traumatized, some cannot even go out in public. The Boko Haram has claimed over 35,000 lives since their 2009 insurgency in Northern Nigeria.
